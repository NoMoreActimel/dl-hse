*Assignment points* 1.5 (+0.5 bonus for the two stage detector /coming soon, here/)
*Deadline*: 23.10.2024 (11:00)
*Hard deadline* 24.10.2024 (11:00) (-0.1 point)

This assignment is taken from the University of Michigan [[https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/][DL for CV
course]]. You are tasked to implement and train FCOS detector
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355 (which we talked about in [[file:~/repos/dl-hse-1/week03-detection2/DL_2CV_04objectdetection_lec02.pdf][lecture2]])

This homework is organized into multiple files:

| File           | Description                                                                                              |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~./fcos.ipynb~ | Notebook that will guide you through the implementation with the scoring at the end.                     |
| ~./fcos.py~    | Main file for the implementation                                                                         |
| ~./utils.py~   | Utilities and helper functions, you do not need to edit this file, but may have a look and understand it |

We recommend you to first write and debug code in your editor of
choice locally (you may use the instructions to setup the environment
from the [[file:~/repos/dl-hse-1/week01-intro/pytorch.ipynb][pytorch]] notebook) and then run training in colab. (/dont
forget to upload the fcos.py file to the colab/, everything else
should be there).

You have to submit both ipynb and py files to anytask (separately, not as an archive).
