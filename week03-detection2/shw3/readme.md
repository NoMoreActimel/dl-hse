**Assignment points**: 1.5 (+0.5 bonus for the two stage detector *coming soon, here*)

**Deadline**: 23.10.2024 (11:00)

**Hard deadline** 24.10.2024 (11:00) (-0.1 point)

This assignment is from the University of Michigan [DL for CV course](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/). Your task is to implement and train the FCOS detector https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355 (which we talked about in [lecture 2](../DL_2CV_04objectdetection_lec02.pdf).

This homework is organized into multiple files:

- [`./fcos.ipynb`](./fcos.ipynb):  Notebook that will guide you through the implementation with the scoring at the end.
- [`./fcos.py`](./fcos.py): The file for the implementation.
- [`./utils.py`](./utils.py): Utilities and helper functions, you do not need to edit this file, but may have a look and understand it.

We recommend you to first write and debug code in your editor of
choice locally (you may use the instructions to setup the environment
from the [[file:~/repos/dl-hse-1/week01-intro/pytorch.ipynb][pytorch]] notebook) and then run training in colab. (/dont
forget to upload the fcos.py file to the colab/, everything else
should be there).

You have to submit both ipynb and py files to anytask (separately, not as an archive).
